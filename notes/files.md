# Organizing files, folders and documents

One of the simplest and most overlooked aspects of being organized is getting your computer files organized. It’s something that’s easy to take for granted, especially when you forget that most people don’t use their computers like us crazy systems-people do.

## Rules

1. Don’t put files on the desktop
2. Limit folder creation
3. Get used to thinking in **hierarchies**
4. `/archive` is your friend

## Naming

1. Use **capital letters** to delimit words, **not spaces**: `RiscManagment.txt`
2. Keep file names **short**, but **meaningful**: `2015GlobalMarketShare.doc` 
3. Dates in the file name always state the date **‘back to front’** in format: `YYYY`, `YYYYMM`, `YYYYMMDD`. 
4. Order the elements in a most appropriate way **to retrieve** the record: `20140630Resume.csv`
5. Give it as a **two-digit** number rather than one in file: `OrgHier2014V02.xls`
 - For bills use syntax `[company][type][date].[ext]` example: `BrightHousePayment20160606.pdf`

## Cloud

It is an absolutely amazing tool for **backing up** your documents and using them between different devices and computers. It’s also great for sharing documents with others.
